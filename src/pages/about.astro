				<div class="content">
					<p>

						Obtaining my baccalaureate (<b>with high honors</b>) at the Montalembert high school in Courbevoie, I decided to follow the engineering path by continuing my studies at ESILV, engineering school located in La DÃ©fense, France. In addition, I also register for the <b>dual diploma of engineer-manager</b> offered by the business school of the same university pole, the EMLV.		
						<br><br>
						I had the chance to do a semester abroad in my 3rd year of engineering school, where I studied at <b>Griffith College, Dublin</b>, Ireland. I was able not only to increase my informatic skills and join the university volleyball team, but also open my mind by exploring the country and its neighbors.
						<br><br>
						Currently in <b>Master 1 major Data & IA at ESILV</b>, I also continue <b>a Master 1 in Finance</b> at EMLV.
						<br><br>
						In addition, I am now a <b>research student</b>, which allows me to work throughout the year with a team of researchers on the <b>theme of AI (NLP, ML)</b> to answer a problem and perhaps (I hope) publish a paper.

				<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I love <b>computers, travel, music and sports</b>, passions that have marked my life since my childhood.
						<br><br>
						From an early age, I showed a keen interest in <b>computer science</b>. I began to explore the world of computers through the eyes of a gamer. When I was younger, I spent my first (many) hours coding in Minecraft, and learning about networks. Now, this passion follows me in my studies, continuing to shape my fascination for the digital world.
						<br><br>
						Travel has always been a source of curiosity for me. I thirst to visit new horizons, meet new cultures and experience exciting adventures. Since my childhood, I have made many memorable trips, which have not failed to enrich me.
						<br><br>
						Music also has a special place in my heart. I learned to play the <b>piano, guitar and even ukulele</b>, thus cultivating a music-loving soul.
						<br><br>
						When it comes to sports, I have practiced a variety of sports including <b>volleyball, basketball, running, badminton, tennis, table tennis, swimming and football</b>. Each of these sports brought me a unique pleasure, allowing me to stay active and fit while developing athletic skills.
						<br><br>
						In short, computers, travel, music and sports are key elements that have <b>enriched my life</b> since my childhood. They reflect my deep passions and varied interests, helping to make me the person I am today, curious, creative and full of energy.
