## Concept
This year, the concept was to put a team of 5-6 students under a project as a Start-Up that has to generate funds to create its idea.
We had to convince a jury that our project was a brilliant idea that they could invest in, and bring proofs for that.

## Steps
<img src="/public/assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="3%"> Finding the idea with the team members

To be honest, the difficult part in an engineering project is always the green thought: in only four months, creating a viable product that could get labelled "made with green thought.".
Since in our team we all did a semester abroad, we chose to create an application that could combine this directive with our recent international experience.

Our idea was oriented around guide counseling and travel guide creator. It was working with an algorithm that could generate a travel guide with the preferences of the user and the recommendations of the application (made with the notations and comments of other users).
We decided to call it TourMate.

To create our POC, we decided to use a No Code App to show result rapidly.

To create our MVP, we decided to reduce the international scope we had so that we could create a small application working on a small part of the world (We chose certain parts of Europe). We then coded it, created the database required.

## Problems encountered and how we faced them
As my team was composed of people that did an international exchange during the 1st semester of the year, we had only 4 months where other teams had the year. We had to push faster.
