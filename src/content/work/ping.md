<h4>Concept</h4>

<p style="width: 100%">
  This year, the concept was to put a team of 5-6 students under a project as a Start-Up that has to generate funds to create its idea.
  We had to convince a jury that our project was a brilliant idea that they could invest in, and bring proofs for that.
</p>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<h5><img src="../../assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="15%"> Finding the idea with the team members</h5>
<p style="width: 100%">
  To be honest, the difficult part in an engineering project is always the green thought: in only four months, creating a viable product that could get labelled "made with green thought.".
  Since in our team we all did a semester abroad, we chose to create an application that could combine this directive with our recent international experience. 
</p>

<h5><img src="../../assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="15%"> Create an identity (logo, name, etc.)</h5>
<p style="width: 100%">
  Our idea was oriented around guide counseling and travel guide creator. It was working with an algorithm that could generate a travel guide with the preferences of the user and the recommendations of the application (made with the notations and comments of other users).
  We decided to call it TourMate.
</p>

<h5><img src="../../assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="15%"> Create our Proof Of Concept (POC)</h5>
<p style="width: 100%">
  To create our POC, we decided to use a No Code App to show result rapidly.
</p>

<h5><img src="../../assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="15%"> Concept our Minimum Valuable Product (MVP)</h5>
<p style="width: 100%">
  To create our MVP, we decided to reduce the international scope we had so that we could create a small application working on a small part of the world (We chose certain parts of Europe). We then coded it, created the database required.
</p>

<h5><img src="../../assets/tourmate_logo.jpg" width="15%"> Prepare ourselves for presentations for the jury</h5>

<h4>Problems encountered and how we faced them</h4>
<p style="width: 100%">
  As my team was composed of people that did an international exchange during the 1st semester of the year, we had only 4 months where other teams had the year. We had to push faster.
