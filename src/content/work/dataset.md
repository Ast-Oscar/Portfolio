  In my third year, I learned to analyze a dataset with all the necessary steps: cleaning, choosing the variables, analyzing, interpretation.
tags:
  - Python

## The process
For this project, we received a dataset needing to be cleaned, it had a lot of erronated values. First, we analyzed the dataset given, and proceed to read its documentation.

Then, we cleaned the data with the process learned throughout the year.

With that, we figured out which variables were interesting to study and we could start.

We mixed a lot of variables because one of the aim of this project was to better our analysis of data.

To represent them, we mainly used plots, barplots, maps and heatmaps.

We kept our program on a **jupyter notebook**.
To present our result, we used **django** to wrap all our representations and analysis.
