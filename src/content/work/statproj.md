  As part of our 2nd year statistics project at ESILV, we must propose a study on the subject of our choice using the statistical techniques used in progress. The goal is to deepen our knowledge while expanding them around this group work.

## Problematic 
We want to understand which criteria and/or parameters allow a video game to find success.
## Summary 
To carry out our study, we approach our problem in three main parts: the univariate study of our sample, a bivariate study of our sample, and the conclusion of the hypothesis.
By deleting the NaN and wrong data, we came across our final dataset. With the use of R, RStudio, and Matlab, we were able to visualize and critic our dataset.

**Example**: Press notes based on the number of video games sold

Here we can analyze that the mean of the score of the press is 7.5, which means that a largely sold video games will have more chances to be considered “good”.

A metric we used to quantify the degree to which two variables are related is the empirical correlation ratio between the Cross-group variance and the total variance.
*A random example to show Empirical correlation ratio:*
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Measurement</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cross-group variance</td>
    <td>144.1957448</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total variance</td>
    <td>147.0663339</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Empirical correlation ratio  </td>
    <td>0.990192401</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The closest an empirical correlation ratio is to 1, the better the correlation is. In this example the study shows that the correlation between the variables studied is very high.

## Problems encountered and how we fixed them
During this study, we realized that it was difficult to answer our problem. However, we were able to draw some trends, relationships and other correlations using our bivariate study.
