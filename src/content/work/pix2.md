## Concept
The concept of this year's project was to introduce the student to the system MOE/MOA (Project Manager/Project Owner). We had to form teams of 6 students and were paired with another team. Each team had to play both roles:
- Project Owner for the idea they came up with
- Project Manager for the idea the paired team came up with
It allowed us to learn how to communicate with the other team and how to get results the way they wanted to. Being in both places really enhanced our vision of how a project is done.

## Steps
- Research and Discovery

First, since the theme was to create an instrument, we had to search what already existed.
- Digital Sprint

Then, we had to generate a lot of ideas to find the one that everyone would agree to
- Command the other team

We delivered the other team a manual of what we expected, and created an **ambassador role** that would be in charge to stay as much in touch with the other team as possible
- Continue delivering until the due date

While we were managing our project, we also worked to deliver theirs so that everything could go as smoothly as possible.

## Problems encountered and how we faced them
Of course, communication was not always perfect, and in periods of rushs, we learned to conciliate both team (the ambassador of the other team and I). They are always disagreements but it never has to end in an argument.

To conclude, I would say this project reflected to me how most systems work and how companies are able to make things work.
It was an entertaining and absorbing project.
