  In my first year, the school entitled us with the subject of creating a system that can generate electricity through mecanical reactions.

## Steps
- State of the art
First, we had to search how the wind turbine was working nowadays and how we could implement its best features. We rapidly figured out that the propellers were the most important parts.
- Calculations
Once we finished studying the history of wind turbine, we had to calculate with the length and angles of the propellers to optimize the energy received. We used **SolidWorks** to simulate our propellers, and once we had satisfying results, we modelized them.
The parts not modelized are made of recyclable tissue, allowing our project to be the most environment-safe possible.
